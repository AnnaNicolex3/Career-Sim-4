Just a few notes about my project. My career sim 4 is in a bit rough shape. I was able to complete a few functions but I still believe them to still be work in progress because I'm not fully sure my code is accurate. My thought process for this project as well as Cap stone is a trendy website as if the reviewers were influencers. Though I have many ideas for the css I wanted I struggled a lot with the functionailty. I started a project board but I also used the class demonstration to help make sure I was on the right track. I struggled a lot with seeding I am still dealing with an error that I'm now believing may have something to do with my computer seeing that some dependcies just aren't working.
